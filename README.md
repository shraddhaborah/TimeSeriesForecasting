# TimeSeriesForecasting
Overview
This project focuses on implementing various time series forecasting models to predict future values based on historical data. Techniques explored include statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA, as well as machine learning approaches such as Prophet and LSTM neural networks.

Objectives
Analyze and preprocess time series data for forecasting.

Implement multiple forecasting models and compare their performance.

Evaluate models using appropriate metrics to determine the most accurate forecasting approach.

Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from [insert data source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository], containing [brief description, e.g., daily temperature readings, stock prices, etc.].

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers.

Performed time series decomposition to understand trend, seasonality, and residuals.

Tested for stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests.

Applied transformations like differencing and log scaling to stabilize variance.

Model Implementation:

ARIMA/SARIMA: Captured autocorrelations and seasonality in the data.

Prophet: Utilized for its ability to handle seasonality and holidays.

LSTM: Leveraged for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Visualized forecast results against actual data to assess model performance.

Results
The LSTM model outperformed others with the lowest RMSE, indicating its effectiveness in capturing complex patterns in the data.

Prophet provided quick and interpretable forecasts with reasonable accuracy.

ARIMA/SARIMA models were effective for datasets with strong autocorrelations and seasonality.

Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of various time series forecasting techniques, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. The LSTM model showed superior performance, especially for datasets with complex patterns, while Prophet offered ease of use and interpretability.

Future Work
Incorporate additional exogenous variables to improve forecast accuracy.

Explore ensemble methods to combine forecasts from multiple models.

Deploy models using Flask or Streamlit for interactive forecasting applications.
